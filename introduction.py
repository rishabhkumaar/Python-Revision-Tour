# ------------------------
# What is Python?
# ------------------------
# Python is a popular, beginner-friendly programming language.
# It's used for web development, data science, AI, automation, and much more.
# Python is known for its easy-to-read syntax and versatility.

# ------------------------
# How to Install Python
# ------------------------
# Step 1: Go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org
# Step 2: Click on 'Downloads' and choose the version for your operating system (Windows/Mac/Linux).
# Step 3: Run the installer. Make sure you check the box that says:
# "Add Python to PATH" before clicking "Install Now".
# Step 4: After installation, open your terminal or command prompt and type:
# python --version
# You should see something like: Python 3.x.x

# ------------------------
# Writing Your First Python Program
# ------------------------

# This is a comment. Python ignores comments. Use them to explain code.

# Let's print a message:
print("Hello, world!")

# ------------------------
# Python Basics
# ------------------------

# Variables - used to store data
name = "Alice"
age = 15

# Data Types - common types in Python
number = 10             # Integer
price = 99.99           # Float (decimal)
is_student = True       # Boolean (True/False)
message = "Welcome!"    # String (text)

# Printing multiple values
print(name, "is", age, "years old.")

# ------------------------
# Taking User Input
# ------------------------

# Uncomment the lines below to try user input
# user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
# print("Hello,", user_name)

# ------------------------
# Simple Math
# ------------------------
x = 5
y = 3
print("Sum:", x + y)
print("Product:", x * y)

# ------------------------
# Conditional Statements
# ------------------------
if age > 13:
    print("You are a teenager.")
else:
    print("You are a child.")

# ------------------------
# Loop Example
# ------------------------
for i in range(5):
    print("Number:", i)

# ------------------------
# Next Steps
# ------------------------
# 1. Learn about lists, tuples, dictionaries
# 2. Practice writing functions
# 3. Explore Python modules like math, random, datetime

# ------------------------
# Tips
# ------------------------
# - Practice daily
# - Break problems into smaller parts
# - Google errors or visit https://stackoverflow.com
# - Use online platforms like Replit, Jupyter Notebook, or VS Code

# Happy coding! ðŸš€
